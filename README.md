# 🍽️ AI-Powered Personalized Meal Planning & Dietary Optimization for Diabetic Patients

## 📖 Overview
This project introduces an **AI-powered meal planning and dietary optimization system** designed to assist diabetic patients in maintaining a healthy lifestyle through **personalized meal recommendations** and **adaptive diet adjustments**.  
By leveraging **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **health data analytics**, the system generates tailored diet plans, monitors user feedback, and continually improves meal suggestions.



## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide **personalized, data-driven meal recommendations** based on medical, dietary, and lifestyle data.  
- Use **AI and deep learning** to analyze food choices, ingredients, and nutritional content.  
- Offer **adaptive feedback** through image recognition and meal tracking.  
- Support users with an intuitive and accessible interface for daily dietary management.



## 💡 Problem Statement
People with diabetes often struggle to maintain consistent, healthy diets due to:
- Generic meal plans lacking personalization.
- Limited understanding of nutrient requirements.
- Difficulty estimating portion sizes and carb content.
- Inconvenient manual tracking systems.

This system addresses these gaps by combining **AI, nutrition science, and user interaction** to create dynamic, personalized dietary guidance.



## 🧠 Key Technologies
- **Machine Learning & AI** – Personalized meal prediction and optimization.
- **Computer Vision (CNN)** – Food recognition and calorie estimation from images.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Voice-based or text-based meal input.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** – Elderly-friendly interface design.
- **Database Systems** – Storage of user health profiles and meal data.
